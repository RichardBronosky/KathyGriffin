Kathy Griffin says something terrible is being done to her.  She is doing everything to herself. It is calculated, brilliant, and wonderful for her career. Last year the biggest comedian in the world, Kevin Hart, performed for just over 1 million people. In the same year, Hillary Clinton got 65 million votes. Let's be generous and say that only 50% of those people support Kathy Griffin's stunt. That makes her the new #1 comedian in the world. Sure, there will be plenty of venues that refuse to allow her to perform because they have to worry about the 50% of people that might stop patronizing the venue. But she does not have to worry about losing fans because she is gaining so many more.  You can stop feeling bad for her. She's doing better than she ever has. The tears are just part of the show.
